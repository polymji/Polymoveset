Main moves: 

-Triple Air Jump: Jump, press Z to do a Double Jump and then press A to do a Triple Jump in the air 

-Cannon Dive: Press B while doing a Triple Jump to make a special dive (it doesn't work after talking with Yoshi). You can use this to go really high 

-Long Air Jump: Press Z while doing a Backflip to do a Long Jump in the air 

-Twirl: You can do a Twirl if you press B while doing a Side Jump or pressing B after a Wall Kick 

-Box Kick: While holding a box, Jump and press B to do a Kick. This allows you to do other things without dropping the box. However, Mario will drop the box if you stay in the ground without jumping

-If you Jump in a slope and press B, Mario will do a Kick instead of a Dive 

-If you press B while falling, Mario will do a Kick instead of a Dive
